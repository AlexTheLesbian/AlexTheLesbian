- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexTheLesbian!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, art, games and other.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding since I'm new.
- 📫 You can reach me by email which is in my profile.
- I am working on a DDLC mod, called "Bright colors". For now, it's broken and you have to enter it with Ren'Py.. You can email me and I can send you the file but I guarantee it won't work :')
